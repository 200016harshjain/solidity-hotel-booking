# solidity-hotel-booking
Trying to build a hotel booking mechanism using smart contracts. I'm going to be writing just the smart contracts for now, will work on my frontend skills later. 

# Basic Features 
## User Side
  - User can see how the total number of rooms and the total number of vacant rooms
  - User can go ahead and book a room by making a payment
  - User can end their booking

## Admin Side
  - Maintain a list of (current) occupant of the rooms at any given times
  - Update the statistics once a booking is made and booking is completed.

### Generic Feature
Allowing only one booking per address at this point. 

Note : Would advise you to not copy this code into a production environment, this is just me learning and there have been no security checks on this code.
