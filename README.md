# solidity-hotel-booking
Trying to build a hotel booking mechanism using smart contracts. I'm going to be writing just the smart contracts for now, will work on my frontend skills later. 

Basic Features 
User Side
a) User can see how the total number of rooms and the total number of vacant rooms
b) User can go ahead and book a room by making a payment
c) User can end their booking

Admin Side
a) Maintain a list of (current) occupant of the rooms at any given times
b) Update the statistics once a booking is made and booking is completed.


Note : Would advise you to not copy this code into a production environment, this is just me learning and there have been no security checks on this code.
